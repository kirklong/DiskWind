# DiskWind
DiskWind modelling code as described in Long+2023, with some updates. Has an additional work in progress reverberation mapping fit implementation. Currently can only be used to fit to the GRAVITY data used in Long+2023, which can be found [here](https://github.com/kirklong/3C273DiskWindPaper). Poorly documented (for now) but will be fixed soon!
